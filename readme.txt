Hello world. I just made changes to readme.txt and trying to figure out how to push them up to github.


MAKE CHANGES AND PUSH
# 											Make your changes. For example, right now, I'm making changes to readme.txt
# git add <file>							(Add the file so that the changes will be staged for commit)
# git commit -m "Note here"
# git push									Push your changes
